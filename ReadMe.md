##PokerFace <(◕___◕)>

**PokerFace** is a Free, lightweight, asynchronous, streaming, scriptable, **reverse proxy**.  

In addition to traditional reverse proxy features such as, http / https sanitizing, load balancing, and ssl bridging, PokerFace is **scriptable**.  

This means it can be used for sophisticated A/B testing, dynamic load balancing, analytics, JavaScript "servlets", content caching, or any other task requiring more than a simple regex match.  

Besides its **scriptability**, PokerFace is small (e.g. easy to audit), extremely fast, and portable.  
It is built on the popular Apache HttpCore NIO libraries to provide top performance, scalability, and standards compliance.
