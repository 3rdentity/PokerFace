##PokerFace <(◕___◕)>

**PokerFace** is a free, lightweight, asynchronous, streaming, HTTP/1.1, scriptable, open source, **reverse proxy**.  

In addition to traditional reverse proxy features such as, http / https sanitizing, load balancing, and ssl bridging, PokerFace is **scriptable**.  

This means it can be used for sophisticated A/B testing, dynamic load balancing, analytics, JavaScript "servlets", content caching, or any other task requiring more than a simple regex match.  

Besides its **scriptability**, PokerFace is small (e.g. easy to audit), extremely fast, and portable.  
It is built on the popular Apache HttpCore NIO libraries to provide top performance, scalability, and standards compliance.

Clarity and simplicity are key principles of PokerFace, so suggestions for improving the documentation are eagerly solicited.

If you like PokerFace, tell everybody about it.  Like any opensource project, the more people using it the better it's going to become.  

If you want to better understand and/or contribute code, here is a [quick overview of the code](http://pcafstockf.github.io/PokerFace/overview-dev.html) to get you started.
