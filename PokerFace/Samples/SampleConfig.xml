		There must be one an only one 'server' element.
		It may contain the following attributes:
		'cpu':			< 0: Use actual number of physical cpu cores in the machine.
		 				>=  1:  The number (up to twice the number of physical cpu cores).
		 				>- 0 && < 1: The number multiplied by the number of physical cpu cores 
		 				(optional, defaults to 0.66)
		'soTimeout':	Enable/disable SO_TIMEOUT (in milliseconds).  The timeout must be > 0. A timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. (optional, defaults to 0)

			Multiple listen elements may be specified. If none are specified, PokerFace default to an http listener on 127.0.0.1:8080
			The listen element may contain the following attriutes:
	 			'address':	Interface on which to listen for incoming connections (optional, defaults to 0.0.0.0) 
				'port':		Port on which to listen for incoming connections (optional, defaults to 80 for insecure and 443 for secure) 
				NOTE: If any of the below encryption options are specified, a 'keystore' element MUST be specified below 
				'secure':	Should encryption be enabled for this port (optional, defaults to false) 
				'protocol':	Type of encryption to use for this port.  If specified, 'secure' is automatically set to 'true'. (optional, defaults to no encryption) 
				'alias':	Alias of keystore certificate representing this server.  If specified, 'secure' is automatically set to 'true'. (optional, if not specified, default java certificate selection will be used) 
				'trustAny':	Trust any certificate a client/browser might present. If false, the client must present a certificate that can be validated by our keystore (below). (optional, defaults to true)

		'targets' supports the same xml attributes as 'server' above, plus:
			'connectTimeout':	Amount of time (in milliseconds) that the connection will block until established or an error occurs. A timeout of zero is interpreted as an infinite timeout. (optional, defaults to 0) 
			'bufferSize':		Buffer size (in KiloBytes) to be used for proxying each connection between the client and a remote target (optional, defaults to 1024K) 
			'trustAny':			Ignore any certificate errors presented by any of the below configured targets (optional, defaults to false) 
			'protocol':			Encryption protocol that PokerFace should request when communicating with the below configured targets (optional, defaults to "TLS") 
			'connMaxTotal':		Maximum number of total connections to remote targets at any given time.  
									 NOTE:  Because PokerFace uses Async NIO, this can be a very high number, BUT should be just less than the number of open sockets supported by your system.
									 (optional, defaults to 1023)
			'connMaxPerRoute':	Maximum number of connections to any one remote target at a time.  
									 NOTE:  Because PokerFace uses Async NIO, this can be a very high number, BUT should be just less than the number of open sockets supported by your system.
									 (optional, defaults to 1023)

			Multiple target elements may be specified.  You could have zero elements however if your scripts were handling all requests. 
			It is perfectly fine to have multiple target's pointing at the same host, but with different 'pattern's.
			NOTE: The ordering of 'target' elements is honored, so you should list more specific target's first.
			ALSO: PLEASE see the Quick Start Guide for a discussion about the 'DocumentRoot' problem that all http proxies face.
			Uri/Url request patterns received from the client/browser which match this expression will be forwarded to this target (unless overridden by a script).
				'pattern':	Patterns may begin or end with a wildcard '*', but will be ignored elsewhere.
								Incoming requests that do not match any of the target patterns will cause PokerFace to return a 404 (NOT_FOUND).
								(required).
				'url':		Url of the that should be prepended to the request received from the client/browser before issuing a request to this target.
								(required).
								NOTE: The '#' anchor itself is optional but if present indicates how many characters should be stripped from the front of the client/browser request before adding it to this 'url' (Please see the Quick Start Guide for further explanation).
